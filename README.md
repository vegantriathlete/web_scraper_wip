## About Marc
In a prior lifetime, Marc was an AS/400 RPG application developer. He left the programming field entirely in 2001 to pursue other interests, including teach High School Math. Marc first fell in love with Drupal in 2008 when he was playing around with creating websites for his own projects. At the time, he didn't have any intention of returning to the programming field; Drupal was just a tool that helped him to get the job done.

After a series of life events conspired to bring him back to programming, he decided to teach himself to be a web developer. Naturally, he chose Drupal as the tool to learn. Marc started building websites for clients in 2010 and now specializes in using Drupal as a framework to build custom web applications.

Marc has attended and presented at many Drupal camps, including DrupalCamp Colorado, BADCamp, MidCamp, Drupal Camp Utah, Texas Camp and Twin Cities Drupal Camp. He attended DrupalCons in Denver, Portland, Austin, Los Angeles and New Orleans. He was a Core Sprint Mentor in New Orleans.
